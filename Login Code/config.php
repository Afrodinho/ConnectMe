    TO-DO: get Site Key, Nonce SALT, and Auth SALT for security purposes.
    
    As of now (12/2/2022), I tried looking into salting and how to get a Site Key; while I understand
    the general principles and why it'd be good to implement, I'm not understanding how to set it up
    with our site and am going to continue without it for now.
